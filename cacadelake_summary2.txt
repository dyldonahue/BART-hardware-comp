The idea of parallel universes, also known as the multiverse, posits the
existence of multiple universes beyond ourobservable universe. Recent
advancements in quantum computing and cosmological observations have renewed
interest in exploring parallel universes. By bridging quantum mechanics,
cosmology, and artificial intelligence, we hope to understand the nature of
reality.
